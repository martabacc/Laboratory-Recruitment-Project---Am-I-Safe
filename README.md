# Am I Safe
A small project conducted to complete Programming Laboratory Recruitment's Assignment. I was given the database topic - and I have to create an app/website/game that related to database topics. This is so abstract that almost every app needs a database.

At the time, I was in my 3rd Semester. So this application is a social media to share accident's location. If there is any reported accidents is close to your location, the app will warn you. So the table would save the location as latitude and longitude, and draws it as a map by using Google Maps Js API.
